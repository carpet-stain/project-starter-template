# Idempotent branch-protection ruleset bootstrap for the short-lived-branch +
# rebase-merge model: a `pull_request` rule restricted to rebase-merge, plus
# `deletion`/`non_fast_forward`, plus required status checks. Run from inside
# the target repo's checkout.
#
# Also asserts the legacy classic branch-protection rule absent: GitHub
# enforces classic protection AND rulesets together, taking the most
# restrictive of the two, so a lingering legacy rule silently overrides the
# ruleset (a legacy strict:true beats the ruleset's strict:false, forcing every
# green PR to "Update branch" and re-run CI before merge). Deleting it here
# makes the ruleset the single source of truth and stops the drift recurring.
#
# Needs Administration scope, which the routine scoped GH_TOKEN deliberately
# lacks — run with `env -u GH_TOKEN -u GITHUB_TOKEN` so gh falls back to a
# full-admin session. Both vars must drop: `.envrc` aliases GITHUB_TOKEN to the
# same scoped token (for git-cliff) and gh prefers GITHUB_TOKEN, so dropping
# GH_TOKEN alone silently keeps the scoped token active. Never wire this into
# CI or a copier post-gen task: it must stay a deliberate, human-invoked step,
# separate from the routine credential.
#
# usage: scripts/bootstrap-branch-protection.sh [branch] [extra-check ...]
#   branch        protected branch (default: repo's default branch)
#   extra-check   additional required status check name, repeatable
#                 (e.g. "lint" — CI job names vary per repo/language;
#                 "single commit" and "conventional commit" are always
#                 required since they come from the pr-guards.yml template
#                 verbatim, and "adr guard" is added automatically when
#                 .github/workflows/adr-guard.yml is present)
#
# Free-tier gotcha: GitHub rulesets need GitHub Pro or a public repo — a
# private repo 403s until upgraded or made public.
#
# Future direction: once repos-as-code work lands (Terraform, github
# provider — tracked on #136), replace this with a github_repository_ruleset
# resource for plan/apply diffing and drift detection across bootstrapped
# repos instead of this one-off "create or silently no-op" script per repo.
# Keep this script only as the interim mechanism until that lands.
